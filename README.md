# Heavy Metal OS

This is my customization of Fedora Silverblue. It is based off of the latest Fedora Silverblue container image.

# Added Packages

distrobox: Fedora Silverblue includes toolbox, which I find to be underwhelming compared to distrobox.

input-remapper: I used this to remap the extra buttons on my Elecom trackballs.

libvirt: I make heavy use of KVM in my work.

# Removed Packages

firefox: I used the Flatpak version of firefox so the RPM installed version isn't needed.
